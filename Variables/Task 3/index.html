    Title : Uppercase const?
    Lang: JavaScript
    Day: 20

    Here we have a constant birthday for the date, and also the age constant.
    The age is calculated from birthday using someCode(), which means a function call that we didn’t explain yet (we will soon!), but the details don’t matter here, the point is that age is calculated somehow based on the birthday.

    Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? For age? Or even for both?

            // Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? For age? Or even for both?

            const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // this is possible cause the date of birth NEVER changes, so the script will be in "hard-coded" era
            const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY);  // The age changes over the years, and evaluated in runtime, so  is a bit “less of a constant” than birthday.

            // const age = someCode(birthday); // Keep lower case for it
